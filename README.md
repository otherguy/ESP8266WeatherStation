I used [RobotDyn yellow/amber colored modules](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32732745628.html). A lot
of other modules will also work, but they need to be 5-pin SPI chainable modules. Be aware of the pinout!

For the ESP8266 board, I used a [KeyeStudio NodeMCU](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32668574859.html) but any
other NodeMCU V2 or V3 board also works.

The knockoff V3 boards are better because they use a CH340 USB controller chip and have the `A0` pin reference
voltage set at `3.3V` instead of `1.0V`, meaning no voltage divider circuit is needed.

### Circuit Board

The circuit board is very simple and just holds the NodeMCU and the 3 LED matrices as
well as the power jack and a trimpot to adjust the LED brightness.

I had 10 boards (1.6mm FR4 ENIG, RoHS, black solder mask) manufactured by [JLPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) for
US$ 44.00 including shipping in April 2021. The black solder mask makes it easy to prevent reflections inside
the case (and it looks gorgeous).

The [Fritzing file](hardware/NodeMCUWeatherStation.fzz) as well as the exported
[Gerber files](hardware/NodeMCUWeatherStation_Gerber.zip) can be found in the [hardware](hardware) folder.

The [`robotdyn-max7219-LED-matrix.fzpz`](hardware/robotdyn-max7219-LED-matrix.fzpz) Fritzing part was made
by [`@vanepp`](https://forum.fritzing.org/u/vanepp) on the Fritzing forums.

## Software

### Prerequisites

Install [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) and [`ampy`](https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy).

```bash
$ pip3 install --user esptool
$ pip3 install --user adafruit-ampy
```

### Install MicroPython

Download the latest [MicroPython firmware for ESP8266](https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/). I used
[`esp8266-20220117-v1.18.bin`](firmware/esp8266-20220117-v1.18.bin) and flash it to the NodeMCU.

_Note:_ The USB serial device (`/dev/tty.usbserial-1430`) will be different, depending on your operating
system, USB controller and port you use.

```bash
$ esptool.py --port /dev/tty.usbserial-1430 erase_flash
$ esptool.py --port /dev/tty.usbserial-1430 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect -fm dio 0x00 firmware/esp8266-20220117-v1.18.bin
```

### Configure Settings

Edit [`secrets.py`](src/secrets.py) and configure the values for your WiFi network (`WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD`).

Next, sign up for a free account on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/), generate
[an API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and set it in the `OW_API_KEY` constant in [`secrets.py`](src/secrets.py).

Find the location you want to display weather data for on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) and set the
`GEO_NAME`, `GEO_LAT` and `GEO_LON` constants in [`secrets.py`](src/secrets.py). `GEO_NAME` is not really used at the
moment, so it's only a reminder for you so you know what place you're looking at.

`DISPLAY_OFF_START` and `DISPLAY_OFF_END` are used to control when the display is turned off, e.g. at night. The value
is the hour in 24-hour format, in UTC. Adjust accordingly. If you're in New York City and you want the display to turn
off from 11pm to 7am, you might want to set `DISPLAY_OFF_START` to `3` and `DISPLAY_OFF_END` to `11`. Set both values
to `0` if you never want to turn off the display.

### Upload Software

Use [Adafruit's `ampy` tool](https://github.com/adafruit/ampy) to upload the software to the NodeMCU.

```bash
$ ampy --port /dev/tty.usbserial-1430 --baud 115200 put src/boot.py
$ ampy --port /dev/tty.usbserial-1430 --baud 115200 put src/secrets.py
$ ampy --port /dev/tty.usbserial-1430 --baud 115200 put src/symbols.py
$ ampy --port /dev/tty.usbserial-1430 --baud 115200 put src/max7219.py
$ ampy --port /dev/tty.usbserial-1430 --baud 115200 put src/main.py
```

## Other

### Trimmer Potentiometer

The trimmer potentiometer at `R1` is used to adjust the brightness of the display. The brightness is always
forced to be at the lowest value when the power jack is unplugged. Whe `DISPLAY_OFF_START` and `DISPLAY_OFF_END`
are set to any other value than `0`, the display will be turned off during the specified time period and the
potentiometer value is ignored.

### LEDs

`LED 1` is used to indicate network activity, while connecting to WiFi or fetching weather data.

`LED 2` is used for debugging purposes. It blinks every 3 seconds (or whatever you set in `BLINK_DELAY`). If it
does not blink, it means that the display is not updating and the NodeMCU has locked up.

### Weather Icons

The weather icons were custom designed using this excellent [LED Matrix Editor](https://git.io/J3N9M).
